## Example of correct answers
################

TP1_exemples.txt: a set of example tabulars with correct answers, to manually test your program on given examples.

################
## Test a new program from a correct program
################

There is a script to produce new tabulars and compare two programs.

compare_two_programs_on_a_set_of_20_examples.sh: automatically compare two programs on a set of 20 examples.

Example usage for executables "./toto" and "./tata":
./compare_two_programs_on_a_set_of_20_examples.sh "./toto" "./tata"

IMPORTANT: you have to respect the two following conventions:

1. the executables are such that "./txtx 98 -30 ... 42" runs program txtx (x equals o or a) on the tabular 98 -30 ... 42

2. your program should print only the two bounds of the interval, separated with a space
